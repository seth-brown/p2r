https://paul.copplest.one/blog/do-nothing.html,Pinboard,Do nothing | Paul Copplestone,"Do nothing The unreasonable effectiveness of doing nothing.  A typical interaction.  I had a colleague send me a message the other day:  12:13pm colleague: hi copple Me: spend 2 minutes pondering how to politely suggest a better method of asynchonous communication.  12:15pm me: hi, how can I help? One minute later  12:16pm colleague: can i check if stripe integration has been removed from xero? cause a client is trying to pay for an invoice via credit card but the button is no longer there Me: do nothing.  12:28pm colleague: ah no worries - it's sorted already Why you should do nothing.  I spent my early career as a sysadmin in a company of about 300 people. These interactions were frequent. Being an young upstart I would jump on them straight away.  Often I would spend hours solving the problem, prioritising it above what I was previously doing, only to find it wasn't important to begin with.  The reason people make these requests is that it removes a burden from the requestor. They have some stress, and they need someone to offload that stress on. This has nothing to do with the actual problem and everything to do with the person's peace of mind.  At some point we realise that we aren't paid to be psychologists, we are paid to solve problems in the order of most important first.  Do less.  Make sure you cut out the signal from the noise. Sometimes the best course of action is no action at all.",advice,2021-07-13T11:19:48Z

This calculator helps show the options (not my site): https://opensocialsecurity.com/ For me, it probably means my wife (4 years older than me with a lower earnings history) would take SS as early as possible, and then I'd take it as late as possible (simultaneously bumping her up to the spousal amount, 1/2 of my amount).",retirement,2021-06-09T09:40:22Z

If you follow a serious strength training program, reduce the S&S frequency to twice a week (& expect slower progress on S&S). Start each practice with three circuits of five reps of Prying Goblet Squats, StrongFirst Hip Bridges, & Haloes. If you do not know any of these drills, purchase the S&S book or find a certified instructor near you. As an option, follow up with several get ups with a shoe or a light weight. The main part: 5 sets of 10 1-Arm Swings per arm and 5 sets of 1 Get Up per arm. Rest actively between sets. Rest long enough between sets to assure no drop-off in technical proficiency, Get Up strength, and Swing power. Progressively but not aggressively reduce the rest intervals. When you reach the 1:1 work-to-rest ratio in one of the exercises--100 total swings in 5 minutes; 10 total Get Ups in 10 minutes--and you can do this strongly almost any day, move up in weight in that exercise. Gradually replace your current training weight with a heavier weight, one set at a time. Go at your own pace; solidify what you have achieved before going further. Fatigue or stress are no excuse for skipping a training session. Have a ligtht day: reduce the weight in one or both exercises, in all or in some sets. Do two-arm shadow swings with a kettlebell close to 30% of your bodyweight or lighter. In light Get Ups, add a 10-sec pause at every stage. When your training weight is 24kg (for women) or 32kg (for men), introduce non-stop swings into your training. Every two weeks take a kettlebell one or more sizes lighter than the one you are currently swinging, and do as many swings as possible without setting the bell down. Pick any swing variation--two-arm, one-arm with multiple hand switches, hand-to-hand, mixed. Any rep that does not fulfill every one of the Swing standards is a no-count. After a brief rest, do your usual Get Ups. Repeat until strong.""",fitness_program,2020-12-03T12:36:37Z

Or as close to possible allowing for days when you need to recover or something come up. He goes into detail in the book about why daily training is preferable to 3-4 x per week. He also mentions in an off-hand way that this is a ""twice a week minimum"" program. So there's leeway. Also, there's only one workout with swings and getups done together in one session. Starting weights - MEN 24kg for swings and 16kg for getups. WOMEN 16kg for swings and 8kg for getups. Warmup - 3 cycles of the following: 5 ""Prying squats"" (goblet squats with a long pause at the bottom where you wiggle around to open up the hips. He advises using a light bell, whatever that means, probably 16/8kg), followed by 5 supine hip bridges, followed by haloes (5 each way, again with a light bell). 3 cycles takes about 5-10 minutes, depending on how long you spend prying your hips open. The Workout Swings - Start with 5x10. Take as much rest as you need, walking around or shaking it off. When you complete all the sets of swings, take a short rest then go on to getups. Getups - Do one rep on each side without a break. That's one set. Do five sets total, resting in between each set. So a total of 10 getups (5 each side). Take as long as you need. Progression - A bit more clear. As you get stronger you add sets to the swings, working up to 10x10 max. You can also do one arm swings or overpowered eccentrics to make it harder. When you've ""mastered"" your weight you starting adding heavier bells. Mastery is doing a daily workout with 10x10 one hand swings in 5 minutes, 1 minute rest, then 5 sets of perfect getups in 10 minutes.",fitnes_program,2020-12-03T12:35:25Z

https://blog.carbonfive.com/2017/08/28/always-squash-and-rebase-your-git-commits/,Pinboard,Always Squash and Rebase your Git Commits,"What is the squash rebase workflow? It’s simple – before you merge a feature branch back into your main branch (often master or develop), your feature branch should be squashed down to a single buildable commit, and then rebased from the up-to-date main branch. Here’s a breakdown.  Pull master branch  git pull origin master  Create bug/feature branch  git checkout -b branchName  Make changes as needed with as many commits that you need to. Make sure the final commit is buildable and all tests pass.  Get the number of commits from the start of your branch. There are a couple of ways to get this. You can simply git log and count your commits, or  git log --graph --decorate --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit  which will show a graph of your commit log history and may be easier to visualize your commits. Sometimes you will have large enough number of commits that counting can become troublesome. In that case grab the SHA from the last commit that your branch branches from.  Squash to 1 commit.  git rebase -i HEAD~[NUMBER OF COMMITS]  OR  git rebase -i [SHA]  If you have previously pushed your code to a remote branch, you will need to force push.  git push origin branchName --force  Checkout master branch  git checkout master  Pull master branch  git pull origin master  Checkout bug/feature branch  git checkout branchName  Rebase from master  git rebase master  Handle any conflicts and make sure your code builds and all tests pass. Force push branch to remote.  git push origin branchName --force  Checkout, merge, and push into master  git checkout master  git merge branchName  git push origin master  Why should you adopt this workflow? If you follow this process it guarantees that ALL commits in master build and pass tests. This simple fact makes debugging an issue much easier. You can use git bisect when trying to find the source of a bug. Git bisect becomes almost completely ineffective  if there are broken commits on the master branch; if you jump to a commit that isn’t clean, it’s difficult or impossible to tell if it introduced the bug.",git,2020-04-15T13:00:44Z

https://jimwendler.com/blogs/jimwendler-com/wendler-correctional-facility,Pinboard,Wendler Correctional Facility,"Do you require a well needed kick in the ass?  Come join us for a brief spell at the Wendler Correctional Facility.  Even a month commitment can help rejuvenate the mind and body. At the W.C.F. you will be expected to do the following:  1. Train your body; lifting, mobility work and conditioning.  2. Train you mind: reading, writing and relaxation.  3. Build your own world: turn off the scam of social media and build the world that allows you to evolve.  No longer be held a slave to the boogeymen that keep so many trapped.  4. Explore art and/or a trade; you build and create something of value to you.  5. Learn that understanding yourself is NOT accepting yourself - growth is paramount to success.  6. Hold yourself to your own high standards. Remember that before you hold anyone to any standard or expect anything from anyone else, regardless of their job or status - hold yourself to (at least) the same standards.  You don't need to spend hours every day on each of these things; a little bit of consistency over a long period of time will work wonders.  Not only will you learn something but you will also feel better about yourself.  You will feel accomplished and have a purpose. Be patient but be efficient; don't waste your life wasting your time.  Turn off the noise and drop in to your own world.  First session will be held in each of our individual houses, alone.",advice,2019-02-12T11:22:04Z

Soak the carrots in the mixture for one hour. Meatballs: Mix all ingredients. Roll into small meatballs with your hands (they might feel wet and heavy – pop them in the fridge or freezer for a few minutes to get them to hold their shape a bit better). Heat a little bit of olive oil over medium high heat. Add the meatballs and fry until golden brown on the outside and fully cooked (not pink) inside. Bowls: Layer the carrots and meatballs over quinoa, rice, or noodles. Top with herbs, peanuts, sesame seeds, and/or spicy mayo.

https://www.elitefts.com/education/customize-the-perfect-intra-workout-shake/,Pinboard,Customize the Perfect Intra-Workout Shake / Elite FTS,"1. Highly Branched Cyclic Dextrin  Purpose: HBCD is a quick-digesting, rapidly-absorbing carbohydrate that’s been broken down into its simplest form so it sinks right into our bloodstream. This makes it perfect for supporting long, high-volume training sessions with a bit of glucose to fuel your pump.  Dose: 15-45 grams (depending on the context of the rest of your nutrition)  2. Citrulline Malate  Purpose: Increases nitrogen production, raises arginine levels in your blood, reduces lactic acid and ammonia build up while training, decreases muscle fatigue, and allows for an increase in ATP and recovery. In short, this does A LOT of great things for your training session, and is quite cheap.  Dose: 6-8 grams  3. Beta Alanine  Purpose: Buffers acid in your muscles while training, which often allows for a few extra reps. As a byproduct, beta alanine can also decrease fatigue while training and increase total workload.  Dose: 3-6 grams depending on your tolerance  4. Creatine  Purpose: Cell membrane health, neuro-protective aid, tissue growth, power output, and a plethora of other benefits to your brain, muscles, liver, and bones.  Dose: 5 grams (no need to load or cycle)  5. Glutamine  Purpose: Any claims that glutamine will help with building muscle are marketing hype and bullshit. That said, it is quite effective for improving gut health and shoring up your intestinal lining.  Dose: 5 grams  6. Essential Amino Acids  Purpose: This is the bigger, badder, more effective brother of BCAAs. EAAs cover all nine amino acids on the spectrum, and can serve as a suitable substitute for a whey protein supplement.  Dose: 10-15 grams  7. Hydromax Glycerol  Purpose: Adding glycerol into the mix of your shake will serve to increase the absorption of the other ingredients.","health, nutrition",2017-12-16T14:11:52Z

http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/SNAFU_Principle,Pinboard,SNAFU Principle - RationalWiki,"The SNAFU Principle is a sociological notion popular among Discordians. In its simplest form, it states that Communication is only possible between equals. In a hierarchy, people inevitably distort the truth when dealing with their superiors, in order to curry favor or escape punishment. As a consequence, said superiors operate from an increasingly distorted view of the world, resulting in bad decisions. SNAFU itself is a military acronym for ""Situation Normal, All Fucked Up"". This is sometimes sanitized for innocent civilians as ""situation normal, all fouled up"", lest they get censored by the FCC (if they make the mistake of using the term in the United States).","wikipedia, psychology, cognition",2015-03-26T15:33:05Z

http://food52.com/recipes/21475-jamie-oliver-s-roasted-shoulder-of-lamb-with-smashed-vegetables-and-greens,Pinboard,Jamie Oliver's Roasted Shoulder of Lamb with Smashed Vegetables and Greens recipe on Food52.com,"For the lamb  1 (4.4-pound) bone-in lamb shoulder Olive oil Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 large bunch fresh rosemary 1 bulb garlic, unpeeled, broken into cloves For the vegetables and mint sauce  1 1/2 pounds peeled potatoes, cut into large chunks 3 large carrots, peeled and cut into small chunks 1/2 a large rutabaga, peeled and cut into small chunks 6 tablespoons butter (divided) 1 pound lovely greens, such as white cabbage, savoy cabbage, Brussels sprouts tops or cavolo nero, leaves separated, stalks finely sliced 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour 2 cups good-quality hot chicken or vegetable stock 2 heaped tablespoons capers, soaked, drained and chopped 1 large bunch fresh mint, leaves picked 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar For the lamb: Heat your oven to full whack (450 to 500 degrees F). Slash the fat side of the lamb all over with a sharp knife. Lay half the sprigs of rosemary and half the garlic cloves on the bottom of a high-sided roasting pan, rub the lamb all over with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Place it in the pan on top of the rosemary and garlic, and put the rest of the rosemary and garlic on top of the lamb. Tightly cover the tray with aluminum foil and place in the oven. Turn the oven down immediately to 325 degrees F and cook for about 4 hours - it's done if you can pull the meat apart easily with 2 forks. If it's tender but not brown as you'd like, uncover and briefly turn up the heat again at the end, till it has a nice brown crust. For the smashed veg: When the lamb is nearly cooked, put the potatoes, carrots and rutabaga into a large pot of boiling salted water and boil hard for 20 minutes or so until you can slide a knife into the rutabaga easily. Drain and allow to steam dry, then smash them up in the pan with most of the butter. If you prefer a smooth texture, add some cooking water. Spoon into a bowl, cover with foil and keep warm over a pan of simmering water. For the sauce and greens: Remove the lamb from the oven and place it on a chopping board. Cover it with foil, then a kitchen towel, and leave it to rest. Put a large pan of salted water on to boil for the greens. Pour away most of the fat from the roasting pan, discarding any bits of rosemary. Put the pan on the stovetop over medium heat and mix in the flour. Add the stock, stirring and scraping all the sticky goodness off the bottom of the pan. You won't need gallons of gravy, just a couple of flavorsome spoonfuls for each serving. Add the capers, turn the heat down and simmer for a few minutes. Finely chop the mint and add it to the sauce with the red wine vinegar at the last minute then pour into a pitcher. Add the greens and stalks to the pan of fast-boiling salted water and cook for 4 to 5 minutes to just soften them. Drain and toss with a knob of butter and a pinch of salt and pepper. Place everything in the middle of the table, and shred the lamb in front of your guests. Absolutely delish!","food, recipe",2015-03-08T23:58:33Z

Two regions are called adjacent if they share a common boundary that is not a corner, where corners are the points shared by three or more regions.[1] For example, in the map of the United States of America, Utah and Arizona are adjacent, but Utah and New Mexico, which only share a point that also belongs to Arizona and Colorado, are not.","color, wikipedia, math",2015-03-04T01:36:42Z

These questions are intentionally difficult and are more on the statistics/modeling side than the data processing side.  You might want ""I don't know, but what I would do is read the following sources...."" to be part of your accepted answers, as that's partly testing honesty and forthrightness of the candidate. The last thing an organization needs is bullshit artists who overpromise what they can do or just make things up.  Note: These aren't definitive or even representative and reflect my own areas of expertise. These are prototype questions, you should alter/edit or formulate your own. You should add details to the questions to deal with the data types you typically deal with.  Your organization needs to define what people being hired into the job actually need to know how to do, and ask about that. If they're not doing a lot of cluster analysis, why would you ask about that? If the person is mostly doing data management/cleaning, primarily ask about that.  Explain what regularization is and why it is useful. What are the benefits and drawbacks of specific methods, such as ridge regression and LASSO? Explain what a local optimum is and why it is important in a specific context, such as k-means clustering. What are specific ways for determining if you have a local optimum problem? What can be done to avoid local optima? Assume you need to generate a predictive model of a quantitative outcome variable using multiple regression. Explain how you intend to validate this model. Explain what precision and recall are. How do they relate to the ROC curve? Explain what a long tailed distribution is and provide three examples of relevant phenomena that have long tails. Why are they important in classification and prediction problems? What is latent semantic indexing? What is it used for? What are the specific limitations of the method? What is the Central Limit Theorem? Explain it. Why is it important? When does it fail to hold? What is statistical power? Explain what resampling methods are and why they are useful. Also explain their limitations. Explain the differences between artificial neural networks with softmax activation, logistic regression, and the maximum entropy classifier. Explain selection bias. Why is it important? How can data management procedures such as missing data handling make it worse? That's 11. I'm sure I could come up with more, but so can others, and it would be good to hear what those are. ","jobapp, interview",2015-02-25T23:29:55Z

It's also to indicate that there is never a time without a king.

http://mathbabe.org/2013/10/11/cumulative-covariance-plots/,Pinboard,Cumulative covariance plots | mathbabe,"Say I am trying to predict “y”: so for a data point at time t, we’ll say we try to predict y(t). I’ll take an “x”, a variable that is expected to predict “y”, and I’ll demean both series x and y, hopefully in a causal way, and I will rename them x’ and y’, and then, making sure I’ve ordered everything with respect to time, I’ll plot the cumulative sum of the product x’(t) * y’(t).  In the case that both x’(t) and y’(t) have the both sign – so they’re both bigger than average or they’re both smaller than average, this product is positive, and otherwise it’s negative. So if you plot the cumulative sum, you get an upwards trend if things are positively correlated and downwards trend if things are negatively correlated. If you think about it, you are computing the numerator of the correlation function, so it is indeed just an unscaled version of total correlation.  Plus, since you ordered everything by time first, you can see how the relationship between these variables evolved over time.  Also, in the case that you are working with financial models, you can make a simplifying assumption that both x and y are pretty well demeaned already (especially at short time scales) and this gives you the cumulative PnL plot of your model. In other words, it tells you how much money your model is making.  So I was doing this exercise of plotting the cumulative covariance with some data the other day, and I got a weird picture. It kind of looked like a “U” plot: it went down dramatically at the beginning, then was pretty flat but trending up, then it went straight up at the end. It ended up not quite as high as it started, which is to say that in terms of straight-up overall correlation, I was calculating something negative but not very large.  But what could account for that U-shape? After some time I realized that the data had been extracted from the database in such a way that, after ordering my data by date, it was hugely biased in the beginning and at the end, in different directions, and that this was unavoidable, and the picture helped me determine exactly which data to exclude from my set.",datascience,2013-10-11T19:02:21Z

http://www.eis.mdx.ac.uk/research/PhDArea/saeed/paper1.pdf,Pinboard,The camel has two humps,"Learning to program is notoriously diﬃcult. A substantial minority of students fails in every introductory programming course in every UK university. Despite heroic academic eﬀort, the proportion has increased rather than decreased over the years. Despite a great deal of research into teaching methods and student responses, we have no idea of the cause. It has long been suspected that some people have a natural aptitude for programming, but until now there has been no psychological test which could detect it. Programming ability is not known to be correlated with age, with sex, or with educational attainment; nor has it been found to be correlated with any of the aptitudes measured in conventional ‘intelligence’ or ‘problem-solving-ability’ tests. We have found a test for programming aptitude, of which we give details. We can predict success or failure even before students have had any contact with any programming language with very high accuracy, and by testing with the same instrument after a few weeks of exposure, with extreme accuracy. We present experimental evidence to support our claim. We point out that programming teaching is useless for those who are bound to fail and pointless for those who are certain to succeed.",programming,2013-09-19T12:17:47Z

Take this adjacency matrix of people and groups and transpose it—that is, flip it over on its side, so that the rows are now the columns and vice versa. Now we have two tables, or matrices, one showing “People by Groups” and the other “Groups by People”. Call the first one the adjacency matrix A and the second one its transpose, AT. Now, as you will recall there are rules for multiplying matrices together. If you multiply out A(AT), you will get a big matrix with 254 rows and 254 columns. That is, it will be a 254x254 “Person by Person” matrix, where both the rows and columns are people (in the same order) and the cells show the number of organizations any particular pair of people both belonged to. Is that not marvelous? I have always thought this operation is somewhat akin to magick, especially as it involves moving one hand down and the other one across in a manner not wholly removed from an incantation.","graph, history, r",2013-06-11T09:28:22Z

It estimates the probability of success more cautiously for small data sets, comes to the same conclusion for large data sets, and adjusts its estimate as it gets more data. Because of this, it is better suited to the situations we are most interested in measuring, the ones where the chance of success is unlikely to be either guaranteed or impossible.","bayes, statistics",2013-05-30T10:25:13Z

http://masanjin.net/blog/bayesian-average,Pinboard,Bayesian averaging,"Nonetheless, the formula is simple, and it has a nice interpretation. Here it is:  Cm+Rvm+v where C is the mean vote across all movies, v is the number of votes, R is the mean rating for the movie, and m is the “minimum number of votes required to be listed in the top 250 (currently 1300)”.  The nice interpretation is this: pretend that, in addition to the v votes that users give a movie, you’re also throwing in m votes of score C each. In effect you’re pushing the scores towards the global average, by m votes.  Is this arbitarary? Actually, no. It’s the mean (i.e. MLE) of the posterior distribution you get when you have a Normal prior with mean C and precision m, and a Normal conditional with variance 1.0.  In other words, you’re starting with a belief that, in the absense of votes, a movie/boardgame should be ranked as average, and you’re assuming that user votes are normally-distributed around the “true” score with variance 1.0. Then you’re looking at the posterior distribution (i.e. the probability distribution that arises as a result of those assumptions), and you’re picking the most likely value from that, which in the case of Gaussians is the mean","bayes, probability",2013-03-26T16:52:23Z

During the previous winter I had become rather seriously ill with one of those carefully named difficulties which are the whispers of approaching age. … And I had seen so many [older men] begin to pack their lives in cotton wool, smother their impulses, hood their passions, and gradually retire from their manhood into a kind of spiritual and physical semi-invalidism. In this they are encouraged by wives, and relatives, and it’s such a sweet trap. Who doesn’t want to be the center for concern? … I knew that in ten or twelve thousand miles driving a truck, alone and unattended, over every kind of road, would be hard work, but to me it represented the antidote for the poison of the professional sick man. … If this projected journey should prove too much then it was time to go anyway.",quotes,2012-02-24T03:06:30Z
